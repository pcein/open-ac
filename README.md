## Notes on building circuits for PT100 based measurements

Wheatstone bridge circuit: http://iitg.vlab.co.in/?sub=61&brch=174&sim=1035&cnt=1 (can't be used as such ... I think it just
gives the idea)

NI app note; explains how to use 3-wire pt100 in bridge form: https://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/CDHW/Sensors/an046.pdf

Microchip app note: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/appnotes/00687c.pdf (precision temp sensing with rtd)
